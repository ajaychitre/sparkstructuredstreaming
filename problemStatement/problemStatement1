 problem 1:

 For every user id, find below values and report it into result_output1 file inside sample-data/output/

        1)  key: "numberDistinctSubDomain"
            value: For every distinct user(uid), how many distinct sub domains have been used in a day

        2)  key: "averageSubDomainEntropy"
            value: For every distinct user(uid), what is the average sub domains entropy of the day

        3)  key: "totalUdpRequest"
            value: For every distinct uid, how many udp requests made

            result_1: // Json output For every uid
            {
                "uid":"xyz", // unique uid
                "numberDistinctSubDomain": N, // total number of distinct sub domain found for this UID
                "totalUdpRequest": N, // total number of udp request for this UID
                "averageSubDomainEntropy": N, // Average Sub domain entropy for this sub domain
            }
